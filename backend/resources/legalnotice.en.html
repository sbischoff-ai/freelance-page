<h5>Liability for contents</h5>
<p>As a service provider I am responsible according to § 7 (1) TMG for my own contents on these pages in accordance
    with the general laws. According to §§ 8-10 TMG I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted
    or stored third-party information or to search for circumstances that indicate illegal activity.</p>
<p>Liabilities to remove or block the use of information according to the general laws remain unaffected by this. Any
    liability in this regard, however, is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete violation of the law.
    As soon as I become aware of such infringements, I will remove these contents immediately.</p>

<h5>Liability for links</h5>
<p>My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore I
    cannot take any responsibility for these external contents. The respective provider or operator is always
    responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible violations
    of the law at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. </p>
<p>A permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. I
    will immediately remove such links as soon as I become aware of any legal infringements.</p>

<h5>Copyright</h5>

    processing, distribution and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law
    shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are
    only permitted for private, non-commercial use. </p>
<p>Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected.
    In particular, contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright
    infringement, please notify me accordingly. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such content
    immediately.</p>
