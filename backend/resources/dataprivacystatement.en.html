<h4>8. privacy policy regarding the use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)</h4>
<p>The person responsible for processing has installed the Google Analytics (with
    anonymization function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the survey,
    Collection and evaluation of data on the behaviour of visitors to websites. A web analysis service
    collects data on, among other things, from which website a data subject accesses a website
    (so-called referrers), which subpages of the Internet page are accessed or how often and for which
    dwell time an underside was considered. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website.
    and used for cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>

<p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,
    Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>

<p>Ferner, the data subject has the option of requesting that the data generated by Google Analytics be recorded.
    to object to the use of data obtained from this website and to the processing of such data by Google
    and prevent one from happening. To do this, the person concerned must create a browser add-on under the link
    https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on shares Google
    Analytics about JavaScript with the fact that no data and information about visits to Internet pages to Google
    Analytics may be transmitted. The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection.

<h4>9. legal basis for the processing</h4>
<p>Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves me as a legal basis for processing operations in which I have obtained consent for
    for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data for the purpose of fulfilling an
    contract to which the data subject is a party is required, such as in the case of
    processing operations which are necessary for the delivery of goods or the rendering of any other service, or for
    the performance of any other service
    or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same applies to such
    processing operations necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, such as in cases of inquiries
    to my products or services. Am I subject to a legal obligation by which a processing of my personal data
    of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the data is based on the following

    hospital or any other third party. Then the processing would be subject to Art. 6 I lit. d
    DS-GVO.
    Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO. The following are based on this legal
    basis

    out for the purposes of
