<p>I am very pleased about your interest in my consulting services. Data protection has a particularly
    high priority
    for me. A use of my websites is generally possible without any indication of personal data.
    However, If a data subject wishes to use special services on my website, processing of personal data may be
    necessary.If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we
    generally obtain the consent of the data subject.</p>

<p>The processing of personal data, for example name, address, e-mail address or telephone number
    of a data subject, is always carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in compliance
    with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to me. With this data protection declaration, I
    would like to inform the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal data that I collect, use and
    process. In addition, data subjects are informed by means of this data protection
    declaration about the data protection rights to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>As the controller, I have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
    protection possible for the personal data processed via this website. Nevertheless, Internet-based data
    transmissions can generally have security gaps, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason,
    every data subject is free to transfer personal data to me in alternative ways, for example by telephone.</p>

<h4>3. Cookies</h4>
<p>My website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored and saved on a computer system via an Internet browser.</p>

<p>Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>

<p>By using cookies, I can provide users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
<p>A cookie can be used to optimize the information and offers on my website in the interests of the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable me to recognize the users of my website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use my website. The user of a website that uses cookies, for example, does not have to enter his access data every time he visits the website, because this is carried out by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online shop. The online shop remembers the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>

<p>The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by my website at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time using an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, under certain circumstances not all functions of our website can be used to their full extent.</p>

<h4>4. Collection of general data and information</h4>
<p>My website collects a series of general data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information is stored in the server's log files. The following can be recorded: (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses my website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that use an accessing system to my website can be controlled, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information that serves to prevent danger in the event of attacks on my information technology systems.</p>

<p>When using this general data and information, I do not draw any conclusions about the person concerned. Rather, this information is required in order to (1) correctly deliver the content of my website, (2) optimize the content of my website and the advertising for it, (3) ensure the long-term functionality of my information technology systems and the technology of my website and ( 4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber attack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore statistically evaluated by me on the one hand and also with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in the context of my freelance work, in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data I process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>

<h4>5. Contact Option via the Website</h4>
<p>Due to legal regulations, this website contains information that enables quick electronic contact and direct communication with me, which also includes a general address for the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the data controller by email or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject will be automatically saved. Such data transmitted voluntarily by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. This personal data is not passed on to third parties.</p>

<h4>6. Routine deletion and blocking of personal data </h4>
<p>The data controller processes and stores personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the storage purpose or if this is done by the European legislator or other legislator in laws or regulations, which of the data controllers subject, was provided.</p>
<p>If the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a storage period stipulated by the European guideline and regulation provider or another responsible legislator expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the legal regulations.</p>

        <h4>8. Data protection provisions for the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
        </h4>
        <p>The controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website.
            Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the collection, collection and evaluation of
            data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects data, among other things,
            from which website a data subject came to a website (so-called referrer), which subpages of the website were
            accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a
            website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.</p>

        <p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,
            Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>

        <p>The person responsible for processing uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google
            Analytics. With this addition, the IP address of the data subject's Internet connection is shortened and
            anonymized by Google if access to our website is from a member state of the European Union or from another
            contracting state to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze visitor flows on this website. Google uses the
            data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of my website, to compile online
            reports for me that show the activities on my website, and to provide other services related to the use of
            my website.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the data subject's information technology system. What cookies are has
            already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is able to analyze the use of my website. Each
            time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the controller and on
            which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology
            system of the data subject is automatically triggered by the respective Google Analytics component To
            transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google
            obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which Google uses, among
            other things, to trace the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission statements.</p>

        <p>Cookies are used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which access was
            made and the frequency of visits to my website by the person concerned. Every time you visit my website,
            this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is
            transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United
            States of America. Google may share this personal data collected through the technical process with third
            parties.</p>

        <p>The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by this website, as already described above, at any
            time by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the
            setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a
            cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by
            Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to and preventing the collection of data generated
            by Google Analytics relating to the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google. To do
            this, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on under the link <a
                href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="link">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. This browser add-on
            tells Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about visits to websites may be
            transmitted to Google Analytics. Google considers the installation of the browser add-on to be an objection.
            If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the
            data subject must reinstall the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is
            uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person who is within their sphere of
            influence, there is the option of reinstalling or reactivating the browser add-on.</p>

        <h4>9. legal basis for the processing</h4>
        <p>Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves me as the legal basis for processing operations where I obtain consent for a
            specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that
            are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of any other service or consideration, the
            processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are
            necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about my products or
            services. If I am subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as for
            the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the
            processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another
            natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to my company were injured and his name,
            age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
            third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR are based. Ultimately, processing
            operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the
            aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if processing is necessary to safeguard the
            legitimate interests of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and
            freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh them. Such processing operations are permitted to us in
            particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he
            took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the person
            responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).
        </p>

        <h4>10. legitimate interests in the processing which are pursued by the controller or a third party</h4>
        <p>Is the processing of personal data based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR is my legitimate interest in carrying out
            my freelance business.</p>

        <h4>11. duration for which the personal data are stored</h4>
        <p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
            After the deadline has expired, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted, provided that it is no
            longer required to fulfill or initiate a contract.</p>

        <h4>12. Legal or contractual regulations for the provision of personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the
            contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of not
            providing</h4>
        <p>I inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also
            result from contractual regulations (e.g. information about the contracting party). Sometimes it may be
            necessary to conclude a contract that a data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently
            be processed by me. For example, the person concerned is obliged to provide us with personal data if I
            conclude a contract with them. Failure to provide personal data would result in the contract not being
            concluded with the person concerned. Before the data subject provides personal data, the data subject must
            contact me. I clarify the person concerned on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal
            data is required by law or contract or is required for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
            obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of not providing the personal data.
